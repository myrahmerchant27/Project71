          constructed in 1851 by French missionaries of the Paris Foreign
           Missions Society. Due to the huge increase in the catholic
            population, this church eventually became inadequate. 
            Hence in 1911, the foundation stone was laid for a new church.

      The food operations and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be more
      organized and efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus of 
      the photograph of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their
      ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices.
      Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with
      a School Canteen Account on the school website  that keeps track of their
      previous meal choices and any dietry requirements they may have.
      Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate 
      all the fuss of money handling, making it safer for staff and students alike.
      Here again, diversity is the key.

        Implemented Online Managememnt System: This informs parents about their child's activities
        in the school, instantly. Once a student reaches the school,  the parents will be informed
        by the status via text messages. This helps the school keep record of the students' 
        absenteeism. Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this is stored in a database,
        which can later be checked by the Admin. The tracker has so much potential that it can 
        identify which students are irregular to their classesand not ready to establish connectivity
        with the actual concepts of their curriculum subjects. As soon as you enter a student's
        Enrollement Number or Name, details like availibility in classes, number of lectures attended
        will be displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilit
        ies.Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that those students who always fool
        their deans are caught in a shorter span just after the admin enters login details into this tracker.
